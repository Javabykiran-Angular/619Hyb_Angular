2 Why Angular?/ advantage of Angular ?/ explain the features of angular?
- Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
- Angular have module ,declarative templates, dependency injection, services ,end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
